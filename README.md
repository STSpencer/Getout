# Getout
Getout is a series of scripts designed to perform deep learning event classification with data from VERITAS. The scripts are mainly to get events out of eventdisplay for deep learning analysis, and then back in again to perform high level astronomical analysis. Uses image_mapping.py classes from CTLearn https://github.com/ctlearn-project/ctlearn. The history of this repo is an unreliable reflection of the analysis performed in my thesis, and all code is provided as is.
